## yardstick Hotdox layout

Work in progress.

Keymap designed for use with `emacs` and lots of programming.

Most of the special keys must stay in similar place, as on the
standard keyboard, since there is big possibility that i will switch
between laptop and Hotdox quite often.  Hence `Esc` in right corner.
